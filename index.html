										<h3>What is Ren'Py? </h3>
										<p>Ren'Py is a visual novel engine
											– used by thousands of creators from around the world –
											that helps you use words, images, and sounds to tell
											interactive stories that run on computers and mobile devices.
											These can be both visual novels and life simulation games.
											The easy to learn script language allows anyone to efficiently
											write large visual novels, while its Python scripting is enough
											for complex simulation games. Ren'Py is open source and free for commercial use.</p>
										<h3>Why we chose that as a game engine?</h3>
										<p>Visual novels are computer-based stories that are told through words, images, sounds, and music.
											Many visual novels also present the player with menu choices that allow the player to control how the story is told.
											Ren'Py's script language makes it easy to write visual novels, and other writing-heavy games. It's easy to learn, and
											scales well to the largest projects. Even without customization, Ren'Py provides the features players have come to expect
											from their visual novels. Life Simulation games, such as management and dating sims, are more interactive games that mix
											story with gameplay. Ren'Py's screen language allows one to create complex interfaces, while its support for the Python
											scripting language allows for complex game logic, if that's what your project requires.</p>
										<div class="in_list">
											<ul>
												<li><p>Being able to use the Python language to for writing down codes</p></li>
												<li><p>Easy to start, grammar of the engine is similar to Python</p></li>
												<li><p>Have high level script language, although hard to learn, but it is perfectly beautiful.</p></li>
												<li><p>Have some product similar to ours: Doki Doki literature Club for example. </p></li>
											</ul>

										<p>It has been our dream to make a visual novel game for ourselves. And here is the chance!</p>

											<p class="bigger"> Last week, We had a special Project, unlike other people who are worrying about the topic and the theme of the topic, I, however, was extremely excited about that project. An idea of having a visual novel game soon came to my mind. The reason was quite complex, and I shall introduce that in the following paragraph.</p>
											<p>First of all, I am an “Otaku” who is a fan of anime, manga, light novels, and of course the visual novel (or galgame). Since I became interested in visual novel games, an aspiration has gained in my heart: “Someday, I will make a visual novel myself!” and luckily, there is a chance for me to realize this dream.</p>
											<p>Secondly, in the last semester of Grade 11, I and Tien worked together and wrote a story which is about 20 thousand words in total. Both we and Reyna were surprised by the work we have done. I remembered that I joked with Tien: “Maybe we can use this as a script of a visual novel someday~” And now, since the chance had come towards us, we started to work together as well, just like the Joke, we are here to create the visual novel that I and Tien are all dreaming about.</p>
											<p>However, when we are searching for some materials about how to build a game, we found out that we are too childish. In order to build a visual novel game, we need to programme, draw the animation for characters and backgrounds, music, OP, ED, Voice actor, and so on. It is almost impossible to just build a game with only two people! (Unless we are geniuses) So we found Nicole, Email and invited them to join our group.</p>
											<p>Therefore, I started to think about the animation for characters, backgrounds, and CG illustrations. As normal students, we do not have enough energy and time to draw that by ourselves, so we decided to find some artists to draw that instead of us. And we almost spent a whole weekend finding the proper illustrator (Someone’s painting style is not in accordance with our game’s type, while others may be too expensive.) But anyway, we found the right one, and she promised to give us the pics this Friday.</p>
											<p>The programme for the game is also difficult. Although we found an application engine particularly for visual novels, it is still very difficult to show the animation, effects, or UI design.</p>
											<div class="quotebox">
												<p>Tien, Harry, Emilia, Nicole, Four of us will be as a team to build a game that we've been dreaming about.</p>
											</div>
											<p>Although the way to make a game is filled with thistles and thorns, we will keep on going and try our best to make it.</p>

											<p class="bigger">Due to the increase of tasks and assignments this week, I just spent less time on my visual novel game. However, I still achieved an important breakthrough.</p>
											<p>To be specific, the first one is that a complicated page had been made for making choices at the end of my story’s prologue. Like what many other visual novels have, there should be some chances for the player to make choices in my project. Compared with directly showing two tags based on the simple code such as True and False menu label, I intended to create a new page or an “image map” to better manifest the alternative for players. – This is because they are going to select one book to start a long and unique plot. Therefore, despite having the official tutorial of the engine I used, it was challenging to outcome this effect. As for the code, it required me not only to prepare two diagrams for both normal and hovered visual expressions but also introduced a function called the hotspot, which enables the engine to judge where the player select and thus trigger a certain program according to the x and y coordinates on the page. To achieve this goal, I tried many times and witnessed my program report errors over and over again. Nevertheless, after a series of tough attempts I did not want to mention, my code successfully worked as what the two pictures show behind.</p>
											<img src="img\about\pro.png">
											<p>Another breakthrough is our illustrator finished her work and released three lovely artworks of characters. Among them, I was surprised that the artwork of Ryoko, one of the main characters, was so amazing and exceeded our expectations. (I pasted it on the next page) Although there was still the lack of some images for the story, these given artworks had allowed us to deal with the further scripting. In addition, now we really need more background music (BGM) to manifest a certain emotion or theme such as sadness, horror, tension, etc. But the website which provides those resources has a limited number of files for one account every day, so it would time me more time to collect some good BGM. In conclusion, it was also a busy week with plenty of outcomes and challenges. I will continue to do the programming so that the prologue can be finished next week.</p>

											<p>
												I'm still refining the script this week. Because the script is just too long. So every time I marked the script, I couldn't feel the end. Fortunately, after two weeks of hard work, I had finished two-thirds of the script. It reminds me of one of Edison's famous sayings - where there is a will, there is a way.<br></p>
											<p class="bigger">Of course, This week I'm also preparing for my character's voice. Before that, I need to be familiar with what kind of character my role is.</p>
											<p>What state she was in when she was talking. Is her voice pure or mellow? Therefore, in order to better integrate into the role when the official dubbing.
											<div class="quotebox">
											<p>I found a lot of Gal games. I listened carefully to the voices of the characters in the game.</p>
											</div>
												<p>All of their timbre is biased towards the Two-dimensional. I felt like I was a girl living in a second dimensional (like a rainbow girl).<br>In this way, I had an idea of where I should work. I would lie in bed every night before going to sleep and read the script and try to dub it. It adds a lot of fun to my life. Although it was the first time in my life, I enjoyed it. Because it can not only enrich my after-school life but also add a lot of experience to me.<br>In addition to all the work I have to do, I got a surprise this week. That's the original map of my character. This is the first time I've seen my character. She wore round glasses and her dark blue hair came down to her waist. There was a hint of coolness and disdain in her eyes. I was pleasantly surprised by this appearance. I think it's really nice! (Photo is at the end) So in order to match such a beautiful role, I will work harder and seriously to complete the dubbing. Strive to make the game experience a deeper sense of immersion.

											<p class="bigger">As I have planned, I have finished the prologue of my visual novel this week, and then, the rest of my time had been mostly spent on my individual work.</p>
											<p>My current progress was that half of the first chapter had been done. I was glad to see the appearance of the main character of my story, Eunice. However, what made me slow down was the complicated transition effects of some small objects such as a book. As a visual novel, manipulating any visible images appropriately is the key. That was why I tried to concentrate on enlarging, shrinking, and moving the artworks and decorations shown on the screen. Despite costing much time, I believed that they were crucial for providing a good reading experience.</p>
											<img src="img/news/c.png">
											<p>On the other hand, my cooperation with Harry had not been thus interrupted. We still worked together for so many things. Among them, the most important item is a mini-game embedded in our visual novel, which came from Harry’s concept – to better manifest and emphasize the scene of conflicts in our stories, we decided to develop the “battle mode” that allows players to control the characters to fight with their enemies. After a series of discussions, we finally aimed to let the mini-game be turn-based like some old Arcade combat games. Initially, the setting including the characters’ Health Points (HP), Magic Points (MP), skills (special abilities), and values of damage caused by their attacks should be well considered. Therefore, it took me one day to come up with so many elements based on the RPG games I had known. As if I were a real game designer, I started comprehensive thinking to ensure that the combat effectiveness of each character would not be too strong or too weak. For instance, I divided characters into some groups, each group belongs to the same career with the same combat role. Characters in the group Auxiliary can use their skills to cure their mates so that their HP will be restored. In a contrast, those who belong to the group Warrior can concentrate on attacking their enemies. Although we did not have an agreement about the final setting, Harry had begun to write codes of the mini-game based on Python. I believed we will make great progress soon.</p>
											<p>In conclusion, as usual, this week was still fulfilling but busy. Nevertheless, I need to hurry up and finish Chapter 1 as soon as possible so that there will be more time to deal with the mini- game.</p>

											<p class="bigger">This week, we kept on working with the coding for our visual novel, which almost drove me crazy.</p>
											<img src="img/news/b.png">
											<p>This is a screen shot of the code in first chapter, and until now (without some sound effect and voice) it is already 334 lines of code.</p>
											<br>
											<p>You can imagine how much our work would be… we have 13 chapter in total (separated into two main story lines), which at least we are going to have 10,000 lines of code. Also, because we wanted to add some extra ending to our script, so the actual code may be even higher than that.</p>
											<br>
											<p>However, when the first chapter (Written by Harry) and the prologue (By Tien), a great sense of satisfaction came from the product that we have gained.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Also, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, almost all of the illustrators handed their work to us, I’ll show a few pics below.</p>
											<img src="img/news/a.png">
											<p>Which offered us courage and brave to keep on coding. (๐॔˃̶ᗜ˂̶๐॓)
												We also met a lot of problems to solve in the code. For stance, the transformation of pictures and movement.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Which cost us two hours to start from zero, and gradually reached the effect we wanted. Although the way to success is still long, but I’ll keep on going!</p>

											<div class="quotebox">
												<p>Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in places in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always exactly what our photography needed, as shooting away from home consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.</p>
											</div>
											<p>Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on or off.</p>
											<p>The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles, with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.</p>

											<p>This week, I had a deeper understanding of programming. I have preliminarily learned the function calculation in programming, and can understand the principle of calculator completed by programming. This is a great achievement in my programming career, and it symbolizes the continuous progress of my programming knowledge.This week I was still working on the script for my game, and rereading it made me understand the story a lot better. Over the next week, I will be voicing characters in the game. I believe that my understanding of the script will be more helpful to my dubbing, so that I can make the characters more vivid and vivid.</p>
											<br>
											<p>During this week, I need to prepare for my upcoming IELTS exam. I did a lot of problems, and I did a bunch of exercises. Although I am not sure that I can get my ideal score, I believe that I will make some progress through these studies.</p>
											<br>
											<p>This week is Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, and the first day of the holiday is also my birthday. I bought a cake and received a gift from my friend. We went to a game arcade and sang at a KTV together. We had a big dinner together in the evening.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Every birthday is memorable to me, but this one is an honor to spend with him. On the last day of the holiday, I plan to go to the Comic-con to play with my friends. After HIGH school, I rarely went to Comic-con. Although I love animation, busy study also compressed my time. It's a good chance to see my friends again and I will cherish it
